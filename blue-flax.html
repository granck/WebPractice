	<p>I am continually <em>amazed</em> at the beautfiul, delicate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linum_lewisii" rel="external" title="Learn more about Blue Flax">Blue Flax</a> that somehow took hold in my garden. They are awash in color every morning, yet not a single flower remains by the afternoon. They are the very definition of ephemeral.</p>

	<p><strong>Warning: Do not approach the zombies <em>under any circumstances</em></strong>. They may <em>look</em> friendly,
		but that's just because they want to eat your arm.</p>
