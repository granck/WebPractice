	<img src="http://localsound.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fallout-Thumbs-Up.jpg" alt="Success" />

	<p>I <em>successfully</em> linked my original blue flax page to this page. We can also <a href="blue-flax.html" rel="internal" title="Back to main page">link</a> this page back to our original page.</p>

	<p>The reason we are referencing to this page is to let you know how to protect yourself from the <strong>ZOMBIES</strong> that will be invading
		the world in a few years. Make sure you get your <a href="http://zombiesurvivalkit.org/" rel="external" title="Zombie survival kit">
			zombie survival kit</a>. It is of the utmost importance that you are familiar with <em>zombie hiding strategies</em>.</p>
	
	<h2>Zombie Hiding Strategies</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Rubbing guts and dirt all over yourself</li>
		<li>Walking with a limp to make them think you're one of them</li>
		<li>Groaning with a hoarse voice so as to not look out of place</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Did you know that most people aren't aware of what they should do during a zombie apocalypse? It's quite scary really, 
		and I don't mean the zombies themselves. Over 75% of all individuals are expected to simply be a meal for the zombies, 
		further strengthening their ranks and providing them with more energy. Barely 1% will be doing the proper thing, 
		<strong>slaying zombies!!</strong>. What can be done to inform more people of the proper etiquette to surivive?</p>

	</h2>Famous Zombie Quotes</h2>

	<p>It's always good to hear exactly what the zombies are thinking when they are attempting to eat us. It puts a greater perspective
		on the experience as a whole. We've gathered a few zombies and got their input on this matter:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Well we don't necessarily enjoy doing it...but you know we have to eat somehow haha.</p>
		<p>Hey if you don't like it then don't get caught. I'm not going to feel bad about you getting caught by a group of zombies that
			can barely pass up a snail. Survival of the fittest baby, you deserve it at that point.</p>
		<p>ARrrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.....haaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>If you really want to learn how to handle yourself against the zombies, get involved with a group called 
		<abbr title="National Alliance Against Zombies">NAAZ</abbr>. They can hook you up with great advice and gear
		that can give any newby the confidence to survive and flourish in the apocalypse.</p>
